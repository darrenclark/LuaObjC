TODO (before I consider it usable):
- objc.call - to call methods w/ selectors that we don't support
- objc.super - to call super methods
	- ideally use fast call code and fallback on exchanging self + super
	  implementations
- create Objective C classes in Lua
	- handle case where LuaContext is destroyed - throw exception?
- coroutines
	- extensible so can be easily adapted to run via NSRunLoop or
	  Cocos2D's CCScheduler or Sparrow's SPJuggler
	- make cancellable and have on cancel handler

TODO (for future):
- support structs in ffi calls
- support Objective C blocks
- support fast calls to Lua-created Objective C classes
- objc.to_ffi

MAYBE (eventually):
- have fenv on userdata be linked directly to Objective-C object
